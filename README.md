OpenLane is a complete toolchain used for physical design in digital VLSI circuits. It is part of the broader open-source hardware initiative and is specifically designed to handle the RTL-to-GDSII flow, automating the steps between Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design and the final layout for chip manufacturing (GDSII). OpenLane is built on top of various other open-source tools to facilitate this process.
### Key Features:
#### 1. RTL to GDSII Automation: OpenLane automates the process of taking RTL designs (usually written in VHDL/Verilog) through the physical design flow, up to generating GDSII files that can be sent to a fabrication foundry.
#### 2.Open-Source Tool Integration: OpenLane integrates multiple open-source tools, such as:
- **Yosys**: For synthesis, translating RTL to a gate-level netlist.
- **OpenROAD**: For place-and-route, performing physical layout steps.
- **Magic**: For layout viewing and DRC (Design Rule Checking).
- **Netgen**:  For LVS (Layout vs. Schematic) checking.
- **KLayout**: For GDSII manipulation and visualization.
#### 3. Flow Steps:
- **Synthesis**: Translates RTL into a gate-level netlist.
- **Floorplanning**: Determines how the major blocks will be arranged on the chip.
- **Placement**: Places standard cells on the floorplan.
- **Routing**: Routes the wires that connect the standard cells.
- **Timing Analysis**: Ensures that the design meets timing requirements.
- **Power and Ground Network (P/G)**: Establishes a network for power delivery and grounding.
- **Design Rule Checking (DRC)**: Ensures the design conforms to the fabrication process rules.
- **Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) Verification**: Confirms that the layout matches the circuit's schematic.
#### 4. Customizable Flow: Users can configure the tool to match different process technology nodes and design constraints.
#### 5. Technology Compatibility: It supports different PDKs (Process Design Kits), including the open-source SkyWater 130nm process.
